# Web session analytics
## Background:
Showwcase is an online platform where members of the tech community connect, 
share their knowledge, work experiences, and projects. It's a great place for people to share, learn, and find new opportunities. Showwcase users can like, follow, comment, and share posts on the platform. The company's goal is to build a platform that encourages users to share, exchange ideas, connect, and learn from other users. Every time a user logs into their Showwcase account, a ​new session​ begins. In each session, we track how and where a user is engaged on the platform.

Key metrics are used including number of likes and comments given, number of bugs occured, inactive duration, and active session duration.
Some new metrics will be created: active and inactive session durations in each hour and minutes.

## Steps Completed:
Data Preparation: data cleaning (handle missing values and outliers)
